    <h1>HTML Element</h1>
    <br>
    <hr>

    <p>An <b>HTML Element</b> consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag, which together define the element's structure and functionality. Elements are the basic building blocks of a webpage and can represent different types of content, such as text, links, images, or headings.

For example, the <p> element for paragraphs includes opening and closing tags with text content in between.</p>

<h1>HTML Element Code Example:</h1>
In this example <p> is a starting tag, </p> is an ending tag and it contains some content between the tags, which form an element
<p>In this example, &lt;img&gt; is a self-closing tag that includes attributes such as src (source) and alt (alternative text).</p>
    <p>HTML elements can also have attributes that provide additional information or modify their behavior. Attributes are included in the opening tag and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=). For example, the &lt;a&gt; element is used to create hyperlinks:</p>
    <pre>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
    <p>In this example, the href attribute specifies the URL of the link.</p>
    <p>Overall, HTML elements are essential for structuring and formatting content on a webpage, and understanding how to use them is fundamental to web development.</p>

    <h1>Some Key Points About HTML Elements</h1>
    <ol>

        <li>Syntax:
        <ul>
            <li>An opening tag indicates where the content begins: <tagname>.
</li>
<li>A closing tag indicates where the content ends: </tagname>.</li>
<li>The actual content resides between the opening and closing tags.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
        <li>Attributes:
        <ul>
            <li>Attributes provide additional information about an element and are included in the opening tag.</li>
            <li>They consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=).</li>
            <li>Example: &lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; (href is the attribute name, and "https://www.example.com" is the attribute value).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
<br>
        <li>Self-Closing Tags:
        <ul>
            <li>Some HTML elements are self-closing and do not require a closing tag.</li>
            <li>Example: &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image"&gt; (the img tag is self-closing).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
<br>
        <li>Nesting:
        <ul>
            <li>HTML elements can be nested within other elements to create complex structures.</li>
            <li>Ensure that nested elements are properly closed in the correct order.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
<br>
        <li>Block vs. Inline Elements:
        <ul>
            <li>Block-level elements (e.g., &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;) start on a new line and take up the full width available.</li>
            <li>Inline elements (e.g., &lt;a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;img&gt;) do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <br>


    </ol>

    <h1>Nested HTML Elements</h1>
    <p>Nested HTML Elements occur when one element is placed inside another, creating a hierarchical structure. This structure is crucial for organizing content on web pages effectively, ensuring that different elements relate logically and visually to each other.</p>
<p> <html> tag contains the <head> and <body>. The <head> and <body> tag contain other elements so it is called a nested element.</p>

<hr>
<h1>Necessary to Add an End Tag</h1>

<p>For non-empty HTML elements, if you forget to add a closing or end tag, modern browsers may automatically add it in some cases.</p>
<p>However, this can cause issues when you add additional HTML elements later on. Therefore, it is best practice to always include the closing tag for non-void HTML elements.</p>

<b>Output: This Image is showing the Browser's Developer Tools and you can see that the missing closing tag of the paragraph element in the above-written code is automatically added by the browser without showing any error.</b>

<h1>HTML Empty Element</h1>
<p>HTML Elements without any content i.e., that do not print anything are called Empty elements. Empty HTML elements do not have an ending tag. For instance
    br,hr,input etc are HTML elements.</p>
    <p>Example: In this example <br> tag doesn't print anything. It is used as a line break that breaks the line between <h2> and <p> tags.</p>

<h1>Block-Level Elements and Inline Elements</h1>
<p>In HTML, elements are broadly categorized into two main types based on how they display in the document layout: block-level elements and inline elements.</p>

<p>HTML elements are categorized into two main types: Block-Level Elements and Inline Elements. Understanding the difference between these two types is crucial for effective web design and layout.</p>
<p><b>1. Block-Level Elements </b>


- Block-level elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width available to them, regardless of their actual content width. This means they stack vertically and can contain other block-level elements as well as inline elements. Here are some examples of block-level elements:</p>
<ul>Examples:
    <li>&lt;div&gt;: A generic container for flow content, often used for styling or layout purposes.</li>
    <li>&lt;p&gt;: Represents a paragraph of text.</li>
    <li>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;: Heading elements, with &lt;h1&gt; being the highest level and &lt;h6&gt; the lowest.</li>
    <li>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;: Unordered
        and ordered list elements, respectively.</li>
    <li>&lt;table&gt;: Used to create a table structure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available (by default).</li>
    <li>They create a "block" of content that is visually separated from other elements.</li>
    <li>Common block-level elements include &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, and &lt;table&gt;.</li>
    <li>Block-level elements can contain other block-level elements as well as inline elements.</li>

</ul>

<hr>
<p><b>2. Inline Elements </b>
- Inline elements, on the other hand, do not start on a new line and only take  
up as much width as necessary based on their content. They flow within the surrounding text and can only contain other inline elements or text. Here are some examples of inline elements:</p>
<ul>Examples:
    <li>&lt;a&gt;: Represents a hyperlink, allowing users to navigate to other pages or resources.</li>
    <li>&lt;span&gt;: A generic inline container for phrasing content,
        often used for styling purposes.</li>
    <li>&lt;img&gt;: Embeds an image in the document.</li>
    <li>&lt;strong&gt;: Indicates strong importance, typically displayed in bold.</li>
    <li>&lt;em&gt;: Indicates emphasis, typically displayed in italics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.</li>
    <li>They flow within the surrounding text and do not create a separate block.</li
    <li>Common inline elements include &lt;a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;.</li>
    <li>Inline elements can only contain other inline elements or text, not block-level elements
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Best Practices When Using HTML Elements</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Always use semantic HTML elements to improve accessibility and SEO.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all opening tags have corresponding closing tags, except for self-closing tags.</li>
    <li>Use attributes appropriately to enhance the functionality and appearance of elements.</li>
    <li>Keep your HTML code clean and well-organized for better readability and maintenance.</li>
    <li>Test your HTML in different browsers to ensure consistent rendering and behavior.</li>

</ul>













    <!-- <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;). Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag, with the content in between.</p>
    <p>For example, the &lt;p&gt; element is used to define a paragraph of text:</p>
    <pre>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    <p>In this example, &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag, &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag, and "This is a paragraph." is the content of the element.</p>
    <p>Some HTML elements are self-closing and do not require a closing tag. For example, the &lt;img&gt; element is used to embed images in a webpage:</p>
    <pre>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image"&gt;</pre>
    <p>In this example, &lt;img&gt; is a self-closing tag that includes attributes such as src (source) and alt (alternative text).</p>
    <p>HTML elements can also have attributes that provide additional information or modify their behavior. Attributes are included in the opening tag and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=). For example, the &lt;a&gt; element is used to create hyperlinks:</p>
    <pre>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
    <p>In this example, the href attribute specifies the URL of the link.</p>
