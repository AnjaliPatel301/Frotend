    <h1>HTML Images</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h2>HTML images are used to add visual content to a webpage. They enhance
the user experience by making the page more engaging and informative.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images can convey information quickly and effectively, often more so than text alone.</li>
    <li>They can be used for decorative purposes, to illustrate concepts, or to provide visual context.</li>
    <li>Proper use of images can improve the overall aesthetics of a webpage.</li>
    <li>Images can also help break up large blocks of text, making content easier to read and navigate.</li>
    <li>The <img> tag is used to embed an image into the webpage.
src attribute: Specifies the source URL of the image, which in this example is https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210915115837/gfg3-300x300.png. The image is loaded from this URL when the webpage is accessed.
alt attribute: Provides alternative text for the image, "GFG image," which describes the image content. If, for any reason, the image cannot be displayed, the text "GFG image" will be shown instead.</li>
    <br>
    <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231217132349/Screenshot-2023-12-17-132233.png" alt="">
    <h3>img - Image Element</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The &lt;img&gt; element is used to embed images in an HTML document.</li>
        <li>It is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag.</li>
        <li>The &lt;img&gt; element has several important attributes that define the image source and its properties.</li>
        <li>Common attributes include:
            <ul>
                <li>src: Specifies the path to the image file (required).</li>
                <li>alt: Provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded (important for accessibility).</li>
                <li>width and height: Define the dimensions of the image in pixels.</li>
                <li>title: Provides additional information about the image, often displayed as a tooltip when hovering over the image.</li>
            </ul>   
        </li>
        <li>Example of an &lt;img&gt; element:
            <br>
            &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image" width="600" height="400"&gt;
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Best Practices for Using HTML Images</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Always include the alt attribute to improve accessibility for users with visual impairments and to provide context if the image fails to load.</li>
        <li>Optimize images for web use by compressing them to reduce file size without significantly compromising quality. This helps improve page load times.</li>
        <li>Use appropriate image formats (e.g., JPEG for photographs, PNG for images with transparency, SVG for scalable graphics).</li>
        <li>Specify width and height attributes to help browsers allocate space for the image while it loads, reducing layout shifts.</li>
        <li>Consider using responsive images with the srcset attribute to serve different image sizes based on the user's device and screen resolution.</li>
        <li>Ensure that images are relevant to the content and enhance the overall user experience rather than distracting from it.</li>
        <li>Use CSS for styling images (e.g., borders, shadows) rather than embedding styles directly in the HTML.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
