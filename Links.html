    <h2>HTML links are used to create hyperlinks that connect one webpage to another or

to different sections within the same webpage. Links are a fundamental part of the web, allowing users to navigate between pages and access related content easily.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Links are created using the &lt;a&gt; (anchor) tag in HTML.</li>
        <li>The &lt;a&gt; tag uses the href attribute to specify the destination URL of the link.</li>
        <li>Links can point to external websites, internal pages within the same website, email addresses, or specific sections of a page using anchor links.</li>
        <li>Links can be styled using CSS to change their appearance, such as color, underline, and hover effects.</li>
        <li>Proper use of links enhances user experience by providing easy navigation and access to related information.</li>
        <li>Search engines also use links to crawl and index web pages, making them important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example of an HTML Link</h2>
    <p>This is an example of a link to <a href="https://www.example.com">Example Website</a>.</p>
