    <h1>Paragraph</h1>
    <p>A paragraph in HTML is simply a block of text enclosed within the <p> tag. The <p> tag helps divide content into manageable, readable sections. Itâ€™s the go-to element for wrapping text in a web page that is meant to be displayed as a distinct paragraph.</p>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h1>How HTML Paragraphs are Rendered?</h1>
    <p>In HTML, when you wrap text inside the <p> tag, it automatically:

Adds space before and after the paragraph to visually separate it from other content.
Breaks the text into a single block, creating an easy-to-read section.</p>
<br><hr>

<h1>Properties of the paragraph Tag</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The browser reduces multiple spaces added by users to a single space.</li>
    <li>If a user adds various lines, the browser compresses them into one line.</li>
    <li>By default, the display of the paragraph element is set to "block," meaning each new paragraph is
        placed on a new line. (Note: This behavior can be modified using CSS.)
    </li>
    <li>Paragraphs are typically separated by a blank line to enhance readability.</li>
    <li>The <p> tag is a block-level element, meaning it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.</li>
        

</ul>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
    <p>Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.</p>
    <h2>Attributes</h2>
    <p>The <p> tag supports the global attributes in HTML, such as id,
        class, style, title, etc. However, it does not have any specific attributes of its own.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Paragraphs are used to structure text content on a web page. They help improve readability by breaking up large blocks of text into smaller, more digestible sections. Each paragraph typically contains one main idea or topic.</p>
    <h2>Styling</h2>
    <p>Paragraphs can be styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). You can change the font, color, size, spacing, alignment, and other visual aspects of paragraphs to match the design of your website.</p>
    <h2>Example with CSS</h2>
    <style>
        p {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            font-size: 16px;
            color: #333;
            line-height: 1.5;
            margin-bottom: 15px;
        }
    </style>
    <p>This paragraph is styled with CSS to have a specific font, size, color, line height, and margin.</p>
