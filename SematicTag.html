    <h1>HTML Sematic Tag</h1>
    <p>Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather      than just presentation. For example, a &lt;form&gt; element indicates that the enclosed
    elements are part of a form that users can fill out. A &lt;table&gt         
    element indicates that the enclosed elements comprise a table. By using semantic HTML,
    web developers can improve the accessibility of their websites and make them easier to
    maintain.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Semantic HTML Elements</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>&lt;header&gt;: Represents the header of a document or section</li>
        <li>&lt;nav&gt;: Represents a section of navigation links</li>
        <li>&lt;main&gt;: Represents the main content of a document</li>
        <li>&lt;article&gt;: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article</li>
        <li>&lt;section&gt;: Represents a section of content within a document</li>
        <li>&lt;aside&gt;: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as a sidebar or pull quote</li>

        <li>&lt;dfn&gt;: Represents the defining instance of a term</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Non-Semantic HTML Elements</h2>
    <p>Non-semantic HTML elements are elements that do not convey any meaning about the content they contain. These elements are primarily used for layout and styling purposes, rather than for structuring content. Examples of non-semantic HTML elements include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;div&gt;: A generic container element used for grouping and styling content</li>
        <li>&lt;span&gt;: A generic inline container element used for styling text</li>
        <li>&lt;b&gt;: Represents bold text, but does not convey any additional meaning</li>
        <li>&lt;i&gt;: Represents italic text, but does not convey any additional meaning</li>
        <li>&lt;font&gt;: Used to specify font styles, but is deprecated in favor of CSS</li>
        <li>&lt;center&gt;: Used to center-align content, but is deprecated in favor of CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While non-semantic elements can be useful for layout and styling, it is generally recommended to use semantic HTML elements whenever possible. This helps to improve the accessibility and maintainability of web pages, as well as making them easier to understand for both humans and machines.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of Using Semantic HTML</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved Accessibility: Semantic HTML elements provide additional context and meaning to screen readers and other assistive technologies, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and understand web content.</li>
        <li>Better SEO: Search engines use semantic HTML to better understand the content of web pages, which can improve search rankings and visibility.</li>
        <li>Easier Maintenance: Semantic HTML makes it easier to maintain and update web pages, as the structure and meaning of the content is clear and well-defined.</li>
        <li>Consistent Styling: Semantic HTML elements provide a consistent way to style and format content, making it easier to create a cohesive design across a website.</li>
        <li>Future-Proofing: As web standards evolve, semantic HTML is more likely to remain relevant and useful than non-semantic elements, which may become deprecated or obsolete over time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, semantic HTML is an important aspect of web development that can improve the accessibility, SEO, maintainability, and overall quality of web pages. By using semantic HTML elements whenever possible, web developers can create more meaningful and well-structured content that is easier to understand and navigate for all users.</p>
