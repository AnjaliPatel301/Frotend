         <h1>dirname Attribute</h1>
        <p>The dirname attribute in HTML is used with input and textarea elements to specify the directionality of the text input. It indicates whether the text should be treated as left-to-right (LTR) or right-to-left (RTL). This attribute is particularly useful for supporting languages that are written in different directions, such as Arabic or Hebrew (which are RTL) versus English or Spanish (which are LTR).</p>
        <p>The dirname attribute can take the following values:</p>
        <p>The dirname attribute can be used on the element and several  types and describes the directionality of the element's text content during form submission. The browser uses this attribute's value to determine whether text the user has entered is left-to-right or right-to-left oriented. When used, the element's text directionality value is included in form submission data along with the dirname attribute's value as the name of the field.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ltr: Indicates that the text direction is left-to-right. This is the default value for most languages.</li>
            <li>rtl: Indicates that the text direction is right-to-left. This is used for languages like Arabic and Hebrew.</li>
            <li>auto: Allows the browser to automatically determine the text direction based on the content entered by the user.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>used</h1>
    <p>Usage notes
The dirname attribute can be used on any element, or any  element with hidden, text, search, tel, url, email, password, submit, reset or button type.

The format of the submitted data is {dirname_value}={direction} where {dirname_value} is the value of the dirname attribute and {direction} is the directionality of the text. For example, if the user enters "Hello" in an element with the attributes name="comment" and dirname="comment-direction", the URL-encoded form submission data for GET requests will be comment=Hello&comment-direction=ltr. The directionality is one of the following:

rtl
The text entered by the user is in a right-to-left writing direction.

ltr
The text entered by the user is in a left-to-right writing direction.

If no text directionality is specified, the user agent will use the directionality of the parent element containing the form, and if that is not specified, the default directionality of the user agent.

    <h1>Example</h1>
    <pre>&lt;form action="/submit" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;label for="comment"&gt;Comment:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;textarea id="comment" name="comment" dirname="comment-direction"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
    <p>In this example, when the user submits the form, the text direction of the comment will be included in the form data with the name "comment-direction". If the user types in a right-to-left language, the submitted data will include "comment-direction=rtl".</p>
    <p>Note: The dirname attribute is not widely supported in all browsers, so it's important to test its functionality across different environments if you plan to use it in your web applications.</p>
