     <h1>for</h1>
        <p>The for attribute in HTML is used to associate a label element with a specific form control, such as an input, textarea, or select element. This association improves accessibility and usability by allowing users to click on the label to focus or activate the corresponding form control.</p>
        <p>The value of the for attribute should match the id attribute of the form control it is associated with. When a user clicks on the label, the browser will automatically focus or activate the corresponding form control.</p>
        <p>Example usage:</p>
        <pre>&lt;label for="username"&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="text" id="username" name="username"&gt;</pre>
        <p>In this example, the label "Username:" is associated with the input field that has the id "username". When a user clicks on the label, the input field will be focused, allowing the user to start typing their username.</p>
        <p>Using the for attribute is important for improving the accessibility of web forms, as it helps screen readers and other assistive technologies to correctly identify and associate labels with their corresponding form controls.</p>
