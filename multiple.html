     <h1>multiple attribute</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The multiple attribute is a boolean attribute that can be added to an <input> element to allow the user to select more than one value.</p>
        <p>This attribute can be used with the following input types: <b>email,
        file</b></p>
        <h2>Example</h2>    
        <form action="/action_page.php">
            <label for="emails">Enter your email addresses:</label><br>
            <input type="email" id="emails" name="emails" multiple><br><br>
            <input type="submit">
          </form> 
          <p>In the example above, the user can enter multiple email addresses in the input field, separated by commas.</p>
          <hr>
          <form action="/action_page.php">
            <label for="myfile">Select one or more files:</label><br>
            <input type="file" id="myfile" name="myfile" multiple><br><br>
            <input type="submit">
          </form> 
          <p>In the example above, the user can select multiple files from their device to upload.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>When the form is submitted, the selected email addresses or files will be sent to the server as an array of values.</p>
            <p>Note: The multiple attribute is not supported in all browsers, so it's important to test your forms in different browsers to ensure compatibility.</p>
            <p>Also, when using the multiple attribute with the file input type, it's important
            to ensure that the server-side script handling the file upload is capable of processing multiple files.</p>
            <p>In addition, when using the multiple attribute with the email input type, it's important to validate the email addresses on the server-side to ensure that they are in the correct format.</p>
            <p>Overall, the multiple attribute is a useful feature for allowing users to select multiple values in a form, but it's important to use it correctly and ensure compatibility across different browsers and server-side scripts.</p>
