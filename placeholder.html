    <h1>placeholder attribute</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The placeholder attribute is used to provide a short hint that describes the expected value of
    an input field (e.g., a sample value or a brief description of the expected format).</p>
    <p>This attribute can be used with the following input types: <b>text,
    search, url, tel, email, password, number, and textarea</b></p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <form action="/action_page.php">
        <label for="name">Name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name"><br><br>
        <label for="email">Email:</label><br>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email"><br><br>
        <input type="submit">
      </form> 
      <p>In the example above, the input fields for name and email have placeholder text that provides a hint to the user about what information is expected in each field.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Note: The placeholder attribute is not a substitute for proper form labels, and it's important to use both labels and placeholders to ensure that users understand the purpose of each input field.</p>
      <p>Also, it's important to ensure that the placeholder text is clear and concise, and that it does not contain any sensitive information or instructions that should not be visible to all users.</p>
      <p>Overall, the placeholder attribute is a useful feature for providing hints to users about the expected input in form fields, but it's important to use it correctly and in conjunction with other form design best practices.</p>
