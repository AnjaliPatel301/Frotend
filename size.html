           <h1>size attribute</h1>
              <hr>
                <p>The size attribute is used to specify the visible width, in characters, of an <input> element.</p>
                <p>This attribute can be used with the following input types: <b>text,
                search, url, tel, email, and password</b></p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <form action="/action_page.php">
                    <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
                    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" size="30"><br><br>
                    <input type="submit">
                  </form> 
                  <p>In the example above, the input field for the username has a size of 30 characters, which means that it will be wide enough to display 30 characters of text.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <form action="/action_page.php">
                    <label for="email">Email:</label><br>
                    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" size="40"><br><br>
                    <input type="submit">
                  </form> 
                  <p>In the example above, the input field for the email has a size of 40 characters, which means that it will be wide enough to display 40 characters of text.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Note: The size attribute is not supported in all browsers, so it's important to test your forms in different browsers to ensure compatibility.</p>
                    <p>Also, it's important to use the size attribute in conjunction with other form design best practices, such as using appropriate labels and providing clear instructions to users.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the size attribute is a useful feature for controlling the visible width of input fields in forms, but it's important to use it correctly and ensure compatibility across different browsers.</p>

                    <h1>Example</h1>
                    <form action="/action_page.php">
                        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
                        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" size="20"><br>
                        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
                        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" size="20"><br><br>
                        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
                        </form>
                        <p>In the example above, both the first name and last name fields have a size of 20 characters. This means that each input field will be wide enough to display 20 characters of text.</p>
                        <p>When the user types in their first name and last name, the input fields will expand to accommodate the text up to the specified size of 20 characters. If the user types in more than 20 characters, the input field will not expand further, and the excess text will be hidden from view.</p>
                        <p>Note: The size attribute is supported in most modern browsers, but it's still important to test your forms in different browsers to ensure compatibility.</p>
                        <p>Also, it's important to use the size attribute in conjunction with other form design best practices, such as using appropriate labels and providing clear instructions to users.</p>
                        <p>Overall, the size attribute is a useful feature for controlling the visible width of input fields in forms, but it's important to use it correctly and ensure compatibility across different browsers.</p>
